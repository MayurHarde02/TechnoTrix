# Password Strength Analysis

# Overview:- 

This project aims to create a password strength checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is going to be responsible for checking the strength of a password for the user's understanding of their password strength by considering the length of the password which will be that the password should contain at least 8 characters and the other is that the password should contain one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character.

# Features:-

1).Checks password length and complexity

2).Detects common patterns and dictionary words

3).Estimates password entropy

4).Provides feedback on password strength

# Prerequisites:-

1).HTML

2).CSS

3).JavaScript

# Approach:-

The password strength checker will be implemented using the following steps:

1).Create an HTML form that includes an input field for entering passwords using some tags that help to build the structure of the project.

2).Styling the project using the CSS some properties that are used border, margin, padding, etc.

3).Utilize JavaScript to analyze the characteristics of passwords and calculate their strengths.

4).Display the assessed strength of passwords using indicators such as colors or progress bars.

5).Provide users with feedback, about their password strength based on predefined criteria.

# Evaluation Criteria:- 

1).At least 1 lowercase letter

2).At least 1 uppercase letter

3).At least 1 digit

4).At least 1 special character

5).At least 8 characters long

6).At least 12 characters long


# Problem & Solution:-

Problem: Weak passwords are one of the leading causes of cybersecurity breaches. Users often create passwords that are easy to guess or reuse across multiple accounts, making them vulnerable to attacks.

Importance: Studies show that over 80% of hacking-related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords. Cybercriminals use techniques like brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks to crack weak passwords, leading to financial and data losses.

Solution: Our Password Strength Analyzer provides real-time feedback on password security, helping users create stronger passwords by analyzing complexity, length, and predictability.

# Technology & Implementation:-

Tech Stack

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend user interface

System Architecture:

1).User inputs a password in the web interface.

2).The frontend validates the input and sends it to the backend for analysis.

3).The backend calculates entropy, checks for dictionary words, and applies strength rules.

4).Feedback is returned to the user with strength level and recommendations.
