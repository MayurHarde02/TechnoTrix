Features:-

1).Checks password length and complexity

2).Detects common patterns and dictionary words

3).Estimates password entropy

4).Provides feedback on password strength

Prerequisites:-

1).HTML

2).CSS

3).JavaScript

Approach:-

The password strength checker will be implemented using the following steps:

1).Create an HTML form that includes an input field for entering passwords using some tags that help to build the structure of the project.

2).Styling the project using the CSS some properties that are used border, margin, padding, etc.

3).Utilize JavaScript to analyze the characteristics of passwords and calculate their strengths.

4).Display the assessed strength of passwords using indicators such as colors or progress bars.

5).Provide users with feedback, about their password strength based on predefined criteria.

Evaluation Criteria:- 

1).At least 1 lowercase letter

2).At least 1 uppercase letter
